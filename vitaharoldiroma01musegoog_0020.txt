The footnotes are marked H„ to lhow that the
readings are those of this Harley Manuscript.
The collatioris are:

Michel in his Chroniques Anglo-Normandcs, recueil
dExtraits et dEcrits relatifs ὰ I'Histoire de

Tome ii, pp. 143-222.

The text of chapters viii. and xii. are omitted
by M. Michel, whose text is otherwise fairly
accurate and faithful. Where the readings of
this edition are quoted in my sootnotes‚ they are
distinguilhed by the letter M.

(ii.) With a very poorly edired copy of the
above text in the Chroniques, by Rev. Dr. Giles,
of C. C. C. Oxford‚ in his Vita Quorundam
