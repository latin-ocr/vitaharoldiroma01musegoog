Angla-Saxonum, “ Original Lives of Anglobaxons
and others who lived before the Conquest.'‘ This
work, which was printed and published for the
'Caxton Society by J. Ruffell Smith, 1854, is now
out of print. The remarkable peculiarities which
the editor evinced in absurdly endeavouring to
reduce the orthography of the manuscript to what
he fancied was a claffical standard, his carelessness
in failing to consult the text of the MS. where the
accuracy of the text of the Chroniques was doubtful,
and the inaccuracies ¹ with which his work abounds
—culminating in his ludicrous footnote concerning
his inability to point to the identification of a
well-known locality in Shropshire-pcombine to
render the text he gives in the Vita absolutely
useless for purposes of critical examination or for
quotation. l have collated a large number of
these numerous departures from the true reading

of the MS. in footnotes distinguished by the

letter G.

The translation of this manuscript into English
is here, as hasbeen said before, for the first time
attempted. mh here l have to thank my col-
league, ΜΓ. Ι. H. Jeayes, for considerable assistance
in the work. The peculiar style and diction, in-
volved and obscure as it is almost throughout
the work (except in a few narrative passages
where the author condescends to write in a lucid
and succinft manner), occasionally takes such

1 Tne. nst word of nis nie, vsu for vna, nous ne nme
'carelessness which runs through the whole of the work.
