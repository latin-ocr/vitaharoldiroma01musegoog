ea que secuntur multa tamen pretermittens bre·
viter et fideliter narrabo. Pervenit autem tandem
vir Domini ad Salopelsyriil scilicet ad territorium

quod Ceswrthin2 nominatur . et ibi per septennium
eodem Moyse illi ministrante heremiticam'vitam
ducensvaldeinquietabaturalatronibusWallensibus.
et dampnis et verberibus vehementer et sepissime
affligebatur. Que omnia pacienter sustinuit . in
omnibus gracias Deo humiliter exhibuit. Set tamen
postmodum ne tribulacio exterior interioris hominis

² H.; Ceswrthm, M.G. Michel maliet no attempt to seeli
sor thie place 3 Gilei contenti himself with saying‚ “The
situation os thia place hai not been identified.’' There ean,
however, be no doubt that “ Ceswrtbin” ii identleal witli
Cheswordi'ne, a parilli in the hundred os North Bradford, iii
the northern division os the county of Salop, four milei south·
eall os Market Draytoii. The churcli ii dedicated to St.
Swithin. According to Eyton‚ Antiquiti'es of Sbropsbi‘re, x. 28,
,etc., Domesday Book enters the manor of Ciseworde·and·
Ceppecanole‚ now Chipiiall‚ iii the Staffordlhire hundred os
Pireholle‚ held immediately of the king by Robert de Stafford.
The celebrated Countesi Godiva held it at the time os
Harold’i hermitage there. The name hai been variously
spelled Chesewurda, Chesworda, Cheswordyn‚ Chesworth,
Chesew’rthin, Cheseword and so forth. It passed into possession
of the great samily of Le strange, but Eytoii wai unaware of
the mention os the place in this MS. John Le Strange
granted the advowson of tlie church to Haughmond Abbey.
There does not appear to be extant any documentary evidence
showing the exasl time when the manor passed out of the
county os Stafford and was accountedi to be iii Shropshire‚ but
from the textos thii passage it ii clear that this had already
talien place besore the writing os the MS. Eyton showi inei·
dentally that it must have been at some period between 1189
and 1255 ; at the latter date it enters as a parcel of Bradford
hundred in the roll os that hundred.
