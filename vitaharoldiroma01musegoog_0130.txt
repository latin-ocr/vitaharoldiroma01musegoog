superfluous, to arrange the things wanting in

But all that my want of lkill can venture to
undertake, is to hew out from the mountain-fide,
and place upon rafts‚ a quarry in some small
degree prepared for a fabric, and to pilot it down
the stream to more convenient fites, and l lhall
feel that I have done this when l have handed
down, in obediente to your injunctions, a feries of
notices which are calculated to benefit the simple
who will take the trouble to study them, gathered
together from ancient books, from current writings,
from true accounts of the faithful, be they who
they may, and gleaned fo as to form the principal
points of interest in this work. So may the gentle
and placid breeze of your prayers wast into the
harbour of a favourable lhore the fragile bark of
my composrtion, rigged as it is with the banner
of the Crofs for its fail, and the prayers of its
faithfulness for its figurehead. Amen.
