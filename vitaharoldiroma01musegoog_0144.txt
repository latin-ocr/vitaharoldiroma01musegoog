The Life of King Harold. 121

he had made sor his health‚ offered costly presents,
gave rich gists to the attendantS, commending
himself to the guardianlhip of that glorious Cross,
and intending to endow it with still more exalted
honour. Rejoiced, he at length departed from
the place in body, but not in spirit, and presented
himself sase and sound to the King, and to the
Queen his fister. The Queen congratulates her
brother: the King rejoices with his soldier: the
whole Court is glad with ajoyous exultation,
not because Harold had recovered his health‚ but
because it was from Heaven he had recovered it.
All, indeed, with one mind applauded; but the
King, as he was holiest‚ rejoices with greater ‚
feeling. He indeed excelled all others ina double
joy, because he was wont to find delight in the
virtues os Christ, who brings to pass such holy
works, and to seed on those advances of devotion
and saith which the accomplilhment os such
miracles was calculated to strengthen in the love
of the same most Holy Redeemer.
