rte Life os King Harold. 123

He considers, als0, that he is bound, sor these
substantias favours, to that man whose heavenly
piety had unlocked to him the approaches to so
many privileges, and resolves to present him with
a reward worthy os his saith and devotion. For
there were only two clergy there to pray and take

’ charge os the service and worship os ‘the Cross‚
though they, indeed, seemed content with their
small emolument and humble dwellings
But this excellent man, eager to exalt the place
and its worship with all classes os its worshippers,
proposes to build there a new temple, to increase
the number os attendants, and to augment their
revenues; and in order that its farne and the throng
os its clergy might display the place in the eyes
os mankind, ennobled as it had been by heavenly
gists, more famous and more glorious, he caused,
bya prudent arrangement, schools to be founded
there, under the direnion os Master Ailard, the
preserver oshis heahh, as has been just now narrated.
Nor was he ssow to bring forth that which he
had conceived in his mind. Foundations of a
large church are rapidly laid3 the walls rise3 lofty
columns at equas distances unite the walls with
interlacing arcades or vaults; aroosos leaden plates
keeps out the wind and the inclemencies os the
weather. The number os clergy is increased froma
shamesul two to the mystic twelve os the company
os the Apostles, and sor this excellent reason, that
. the same number os men who had told forth Christ’s
glory to the world from the beginning, might serve
in eternas praise in the temple os His holy Cross.
