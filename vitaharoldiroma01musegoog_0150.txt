The Life of King Harold. 127

ought to be obje&s of the greatest veneration both
to the Greeks and the Latins. These men Henry
most honourably adorned with offices built for
regular canons; but Harold‚ with the kindest
thought, increased their incomes. For by these
men the Lord’s flock, which served the Lord there
in holiness and righteousness, is supported3 by
them day by day innumerable crowds of travellers
obtain all the benefits of humanity; at their hands
the traveller and the hungry man receive food and
provisrons3 from them the fick man receives
attention, and he who is cold a rovering, and
the stranger and foreigner a roof to cover him—in
a word, everyone who is in need obtains at the
hands of these men affistance suitable to his
neceffities.
