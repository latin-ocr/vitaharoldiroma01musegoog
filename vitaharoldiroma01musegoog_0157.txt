134 The Lifi os King Harold.

pupil it may the more plainly be shown on what a
pinnacle of perfectiori the life and conversation of
the teacher shines sorth. He, indeed, making
mention os Harold, would call him his master,
rejoicing that he had in heaven an advocate whom,
when on earth, he had as a preceptor. This, then,
is the man by whom, as hae been said above, as
well as by others who knew the man os God, and
how his position of life was ordered and changed
according to place and time, these things have
been arranged and made known. And of these
some were ignorant that Harold was once, when
he lived,a crowned king, but were witnesses os
his conversation and knew well in what places he
lived from the time when he spent his lise in
solitude in England. For he, dreading srom his
heart the glory of the world, of which he had ex·
perienced such ignoble and unhappy results, when
he resolved to live in his own country, took a new
name, and changed from time to time the place
os his dwelling, lest by some chance it should be
betrayed to anyone. But we will discourse os
these things in their order below. Let us now
from this excessrve digression proceed without
· more delay to the narration of what we have

ι already begun.
