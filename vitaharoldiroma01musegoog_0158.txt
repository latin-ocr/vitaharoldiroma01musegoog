 

CHAP. V.—How a certain Saracen 'woman

found him half dead among-st his affailants,
brought him to Winchester, and healed him ax
he lay there concealed for twa years; and how
besougltt aut the Saxam and Danes ta callet‘a⁸ allies
against the Numam, but was uffuccgssful.

’,Ξ-ζ» HEN, then, the Englifh zrmy wa,
beaten and oven-come at the first
attack of the Nonnans, King Harold,
· ²⁴ pierced with numerous blows, is
thrown to the ground amongst the dead; yet his
wounds, many and deachly though they were,
could not altogether deprive of life him whom the
goodness of the Savium· had most happily ordained
to restore to life and victory. Thus, as the
enemy's host departed from the scene of the
sszughter, he, who the day before was so powerful,
is found stunned and scarcely breathing by some
women whom pity and a defire to bind up the
wounds of the maimed had drawn thither. They
a& the part of Samaritam by him, and binding up
his wounds, they carry him to a neighbouring hut.
