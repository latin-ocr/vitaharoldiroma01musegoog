Tsre List of King Harosd. 141

ceive from Him an eternas kingdom or an eternal
punishment. He knows that if he were to pro-
pose to make war against Him, and were to go
against Him with ten thousand, that He would
come to meet him with twenty thousand, whose
unexpedted coming and whose extraordinary pre-
parations sometimes exterminate and destroy him
whom He assails secretly and powerfully when
He is least expected, and he who is unprepared
for Him.

Putting on one side, then, his vain desire of a
temporal kingdom, and casting off the fatal purpose
· osan earthly strife, he proposes to send an embasly
to that King who is still far off, impelsing him
to inquire from Him what are the terms of a
true peace. And fearing that His anger will be
increased. by his offences, and lest, perchance‚ his
embassy alone may not be sufficient to propitiate
Him, he resolves to seek out and entreat others,
fitting and suited to the purpose, with all the
prayers he can, to help him and interpose for him
with the angry King, whose favour and glory
alone he thought worthy of soliciting. Thus the
outward appearance and inward disposition of
Harosd are both suddenly changed. The hand
which he was wont to arm, he supports witha
spear shortened into 3 staff. Instead of 3 shiesd, a
walset hangs from his neck. His head, which he
was wont to equip with a helmet, and adom with
adiadem, is shaded with 3 head-dress. His feet
and legs, in the place of sandals and greaves, are
either altogether bare, or encased in stockings.
