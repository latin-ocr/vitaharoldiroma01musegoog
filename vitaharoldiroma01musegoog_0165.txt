142 she Life of King Harold.

But let me relate the rest in a sew words: all the
armour os the warrior, the whole adornment os
this mighty man, is either lest off altogether, or
else worn sor the humiliation and punishment os
the penitent. Not only is the breastplate not
thrown off from his shoulders, arms, loins, and srde,
but it is brought closer to his body; for the inner
garments being taken off and thrown afide, the
roughness os the metal is next to the bare flesh.
Thus when awake, he walks, not indeed armed so
much as imprisoned in armour. Thus when he
sleeps, a bedl does not receive him, buthe is em· ⁴
bedded ina cuirass. The change in the outer
appearance which he assumed was wonderful.
Pleasant indeed was this great alteration in such a
man, both to the angels and all the saints; but sar
more pleasmg was the change wrought in the inner

man by God the Judge‚ who created and formed Ι

in him light instead os darkness, and turned in a
miraculous manner the man’s whole nature.

ln truth, l say, the change was not brought
about by the hand os man, but by the right
hand os the Most High, at whose word a cruel
and savage nature sostens into mildness and gentle-
ness, exaltation becomes humility3 but who can
tell os all the benefits os so blessed a change?
That l may condense in a few words an endless
matter: ,by this change, lull os the flesh and the
world was transformed into a contempt and hatred
os such things, and yielded to a desire and love for
heavenly things.
