before he became a King, he vifited the rqsting-places
of the holy Apostles.

   

’ x NSTRUCTED with an unffion which
τ’ now taught him concerning all
*⁸ Γ things, he feels that he must care-
* fully conceal that treasure of heavenly
aspiration, lest, if publilhed abi-oud thoughtleffly,
it might be exposed to robbery. For firstlings of
sheep or kine ase not {horn nor put to the plough,
and first-fruits were deemed uncloen.

Therefore, inſtrusted by such divine orders as
these from the Holy Spirit, he leaves all his friends
who had seemed to cloeve to him up to that time:
he deserts his kinssolk: he retii-es stcretly from all
who had known him: he approach& peopla
hitherto unknown to him: he seeks for supportem
sar and wide amongst those who are not unknown
to him, but who were in days gone by indeed
well known to and loved by him, and now more
closely united in a feeling of devotion. This
