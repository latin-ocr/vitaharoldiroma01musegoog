The Life of King Harold. 147

pearls ‘of priceless value which he had lawfully
obtained from their former possessors, as they
indeed confell'ed. Returning to his own country,
then, for the violence of the Romans could not
rob him of the prayers and favour of the above-
mentioned witnelles of Christ, and having managed
to obtain, in spite os all, some very precious relics
at Rome, he brought them home to be reverently
preserved in the church which has fo often been
mentioned.

And if anyone cares to know at greater length
the watchfulness of his devotion and care in
acquiring and preserving these relies of the saints,
let him read carefully the treatise above-mentioned
concerning the finding of the Cross at Waltham.
But we ourselves, omitting what has been written
by ancient writerS, will give our pen a new duty,
and follow, as we began to d0, our new pilgrim,
with Christ for a gulde. And if we are unable to
accompany him to every place and on every srngle
day as he wanders through many countries of
Christendom and spends fo beneficially his time;
or if we do not know and cannot relate every
single thing he did or suffered on his long pil-
grimage, let us at all events, following him as he
is now already a long way off from our shores, go
and meet him as he returns to us with all speed.
And let us give God highest praise who was with
him and guided him, and who at no time or place
deserted him, and let us do honour to him in the
Lord, who comes, indeed, in the name of the Lord.
