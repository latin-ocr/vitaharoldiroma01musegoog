152 The Lffe ofKing Harold.

kingdom which he had sworn to preserve for him,
and thus broke his oath, is stated, wonderful to
relate, to have sbed its bark, and to have lost its
greenness and its foliage. A sight well worth
seeing, sor a tree which wasa little time before
remarkable sor the number and thickness os its
leaves, shrivelled up from the roots‚ as quiclcly as
did the gourd os Jonah and the olive os that other
prophet, and all its branches became white. The
lasting nature os the withered tree, an indestruc-
tible oak, increases the miracle os the blight salling
upon it, and this we have frequently, in common
with many more, wondered at. '
Wh0, indeed, would not be amazed that this oak,
os such vast magnitude, not weakened by small
branches but everywhere unbroken, from the lowest
roots to the topmost leaves, thus slripped of every
covering osbarlc, had not already yielded to old age
and course os time; or wasted by decay, or beaten
upon by the violence os the winds, and floodod by
many rains, had not grown rotten or, at least, bent!
But when we saw the tree one hundred and sorty
years aster this event,when it was still to be seen thus
marked, a man of Rouen declared that the crime
os so enormous a perjury had been thus signalized
by Heaven. The ill-sated tree still stands ata
short distance from the city itsels, overhanging a
pleasant glade, which is not sar srom the bridge
over the Seine stretching towards the hermits of
Grandmont. Theman os Rouen is said to have
presumed, at the unusual omen, that London would

¹ firsl be subdued.
