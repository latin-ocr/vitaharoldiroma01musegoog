156 we Life wrong aaron. ’

Harold at length, by the unanimous advice os all,-
is raised to the throne. But that this had not
happened with the divine Will had been declared
a little time after from heaven. For when the
Norwegian King, sailing with a numerous fleet,
had made an entry into England‚ attacking the
province os York with fire 3ηά sword, and had
begun to lay waste everything that carne in his
way, and when the newly-elected King was hasten-
ing to meet him with an army he had collected, he'
was suddenly seized with most violent pain in his leg.

F ettered as he thus had become, and in agony for
the peril os his subjests rather than at his own
pain, passing nearly the whole night without sleep
in fighs and prayers‚ he begged sor the familiar
assistance of the Holy Cross. In the same night
there appeared to that servant of the Lord‚ Elsrn,
the Abbot of Ramsey, King Edward‚ the holy and
watchsul desendet of his people‚ the predecessor os
our sorrowing and afflicted hero, telling the Abbot
’ the missortune os the King which had happened
to his body and spirit, showing him besides the
King's thoughts as he lay upon his bed; sending
him, and saying to him, “ Rise‚ go, and tell your
King from me the remedy sor his present pain and
the threatened war, that, at my interceshon, God
has granted him the vidtory. Let the revelation ’
of his heart's thoughts bc a sign to him from
heaven that the remedy is to be attended to, 3ηά
let the argument os this unwonted revelation bea
certain omen os his obtaining the vidtory.'' So the
King, to speak brielly, is cured by divine favour,
