· llle Life of King Harola. 161

right hand, as soon as a little of the surface had

been bored by an iron, was found to possess a soft-
ness whence it emitted blood; but it lost not its
hardness, whereby it repelled the hardesl auger.
The right hand of the Lord gave this quality to the
right hand of His image, which, as the Psalmist
sang, hath given strength, whence also it is asitting
quality of this material right hand, that being made
illustrious by so many figns, and glorious by so many

prodigies, it may seem to declare, not so much in
words as in faa, “The right hand of the Lord

hath exalted me3 the right hand of the Lord hath
given strength.’'

Now, we have related all this to the end that the ,

manifold nature of the heavenly power might appear,
which was shown in this bending of the sacred head
of the holy image; for, as we have said, in the srlver
as well as the stony substance, this wonderful aa of
heavenly condescenfion and power shone forth to
our eyes, which we can slill behold to-day near
the horn of the altar where the occurrence hap-
· pened. For the stone did not crack, nor did the
filver plate experience a cleft, or contra& a wrinkle,
though it was stretched to an unwonted degree
from that part of the neck through such a bending3
nor was it seen to be folded in the least propor-
tion from the region of the neck and jaw, But
there was an alteration, and not a small one, from its
original position, for whereas the chin of the image,
as we have formerly heard, stood straight out, we
see it now hangs down and settled upon the breast,
by reason of the bending which we have described.
