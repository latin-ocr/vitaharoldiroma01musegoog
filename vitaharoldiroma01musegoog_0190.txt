The Life of King Harold. 167

knoweth all things. Aa sar as we have been able, '

we have tried by means of what we have related,
and which appeared to us not irrelevant to the
subject, to remove the stumbling-stones from the
way, and to make the path plain, the actual facts,
as we trust, guiding us.

lt remains for us now to go and meet, with
what speed we may, our King and patron, who is
returning to us from his long journey, and to
follow him to the best of our power with the
devoted service os our trusty pen, as he returns
home first to the home of the Angles and then os
the Angels. But he himself, by accusrng and
judging himself, strove so to anticipate the judg-
ment of man and os God that it mattered very
little to him to be judged by those who, according
as they were dispofed towards him by hatred or
goodwill,judge according to their human lights,
generally wrongly, and scldom rightly.
