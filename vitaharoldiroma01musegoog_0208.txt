The Lift os King Harold. 18 5

unaccustomed to the truth, this man is known to
have introduced into his history what it is plain
was the reverse of the truth, however much the
truth of things is relied on to strengthen one’s story.

But in the other things, which he commented
upon at one time with a pen of gold, at another
with a pen steeped with pitch, concerning the
merits or manners of Harold, as his mind in-
formed him or report suggested, perhaps he
wandered from the pathos truth somewhat par-
donably3 but he fell more severely when he at·
tacked the very Anointed of the Lord. For he
turned upon himself in his impetuofity three
spears, by which it chanced that, not his person
indeed, but his truth was attacked. He said that
Harold met his death hyan arrow-wound upon
his head3 he said that the soldier who attacked
the dead King’s thigh had been driven from the
army after censure from the victorious Duke3 he
related that money was offered by his mother to
the vidorious William for a royal funeral, but
that he was taken away, without payment of
money, and buried at Waltham. Thus, concern-
ing the thigh, the head, and the man’s whole
body, the tongue of the speaker, who writes many
things in secret, runs riot with more licente than
the armed hand of the soldier who fights openly.
But the Lord has delivered the poor and needy
man-whom He has proved to be more mighty
in most things than many orators and kings—srom
the arrow of the mouth of the one and srom the
spear in the hand os the other.
