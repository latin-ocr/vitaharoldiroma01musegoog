186 le Life os King Harold.

1 do not speak of all these things; but the
Lord will give to him who walks in fimplicity the
xpower to understand what 1 write, to think what
1 think. But a contemporary of the present writer
has written in temperate language an account of
these things (namely‚ Ethelred, a venerable abbot)
in the life of his holy predecessor, King Edward.
He says, indeed, that Harold either fell in battle

or escaped, not without wounds, reserved for re-
pentance.
