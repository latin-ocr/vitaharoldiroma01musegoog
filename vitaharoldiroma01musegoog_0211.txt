188 The Lrfi‘ of King Harold.

officers in authority, and moreau objedt of com-
paffion. But this woman seemed more fitted than
all others to carry out this affair, because lhe could
more easily discover amongst the thousands os
corpses him lhe sought, and, would handle his
remains more tenderly‚ because lhe loved him ex-
ceedingly, and knew him well, inasmuch as it was
clear that lhe had been frequently present in the
secret places of his chamber. But when lhe reached
the ill-omened spot, lhe heard srom many Normans‚
who were everywhere boasting, that the King of
the, Angles was ignominiously beaten, with his
cross broken in halves, and that he was lying on
the battle-field, killed amongst the ssain.

But let the reader see what turned out to bea
truer account. For others thought that they who
had carried off the King hals dead, had set about
this report, soreseeing that it would be dangerous
to them and to him, and would prove their certain
destrudtion, if the enemy should hear that he was
alive. We must not therefore wonder at the
mistake os the woman wh0, unable to discern the
features of the body—hacked about as it was,
covered with blood, already becoming black and
decomposed, smce lhe could not find one which
lhe could be certain was the King's—seized hold
of, and carried off with her, another man's mangled
corpse, to satisfy the public estimation. And this
was the body which was received in all reverence
by the Canons of Waltham, without questioning
the truth of the matter, and was handed over sor

burial in the Church os the Holy Crosa.
