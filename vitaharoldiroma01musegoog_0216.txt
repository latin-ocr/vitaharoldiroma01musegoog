his native soil to seek a fatherland again in it?
And does not the Lord say to Abraham, “Get
thee out of thy country ;” and again in the Psalm,
“ Forget thine own people and-thy father’s house ''?
. And if the sweetness or recolleetion of his land,

his people, and his father‘s house could not hold
him of less age or inferior strength of mind, or
holiness of purpose, would it lead or would it
attratt him to all these things whereby the more
he advanced the more perse& he became? but
would not that saying of the evangelist thunder in
the spiritual ears of the man who was pondering
in his heart over the sweetness he had lost, “No
man putting his hand to the plough, and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of God ’'? And again,
the well-meaning writer does not confider what
sort of a thing that native soil was to him-how
it was still unchanged, how it was hostile to him
and his party, and how it could even seem to him
to be irksome when he looked back upon the
whole of his life, even if he was still led along by
an affection tenderet than ever.
