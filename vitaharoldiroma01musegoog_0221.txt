wha succeeded the holy Harold on the death af that
most pinus King, and the miracles which were per-
formed by his means after he departed to the Lord,
preceded by a short account af his doings and suffer-
ings from the time he lost his earthly kingdom*

»ᾖ Τ is written that tribulation worketh
ἶ patience, patience experiente, expe-
¹= dence hope. For the experiente of
patience and confirmation os a pious
hope, God sometimes pei-mita His people to have
tribulation in this life that He may free them
from an etei-nal tribulation, wherefore He also
allowed the venerable Harold, once King of the
Angla, to have tribulation, and to be overcome
by his enemies, and expelled from his kingdom,
lest he might gro‘w proud because he had gained a
viotory; and lest, having been raised to kingly
power, he might put on one side the love of God
because of his prosperity, but having been plaoed
in poverty that he might live a more holy and
bleffed life, while he had his mind altogether ᾗτε
stom earthly oocupations.
